However, this seems dubiously high.

""We pre-train each model for 2^19 = 524,288 steps on C4 before fine-tuning.""
""In total, this batch size and number of steps corresponds to pre-training on 2^35 ≈ 34B tokens.""
""To compare these mixing strategies on equal footing with our baseline pre-train-then-fine-tune results, we train multi-task models for the same total number of steps: 2^19 + 2^18 = 786,432""
Using the 6DN approximation gives: 6 FLOP/token/param * 2^35 pretrain tokens * (1+1/2 finetune tokens per pretrain token) * 1 iteration of training data* 2.8 billion parameters = 8.659e20 FLOP
