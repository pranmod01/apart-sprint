This is consistent with OpenAI's statement that GPT-4.5 was a “new order of magnitude in compute” compared to previous models (e.g. GPT-4, which was ~2e25), suggesting around 2e26 FLOP. But they could have meant this somewhat loosely.

https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama4/MODEL_CARD.md   

Maverick was trained using co-distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth. It isn't 100% clear that all 22T tokens used distillation, but we assume this for the time being.

Estimating training compute from parameters and tokens:
Compute = 6 FLOP per token per parameter * 17B active parameters * 22T tokens = 2.244e24 FLOP
(Implying mean throughput was 262 TFLOPS/GPU, or 13.2% MFU in FP8)


The model card also states that Llama 4 Maverick used 2.38M H100-hours.
The blog post gives a figure of 390 TFLOPS/GPU, but this may have been the utilization rate for Behemoth, or all of the models together. Using this utilization, we have:
Compute = 390 TFLOP/s * 2.38 million hours = 3.342e24 FLOP
