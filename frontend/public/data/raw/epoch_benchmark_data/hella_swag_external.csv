40GB dataset is approximately 8B words, or 1/0.75 * 8B = 10.66B tokens.

The number of epochs is not reported, but another paper [1] claims in table 1 that it is 20 or 100 epochs, and another paper [2] claims 12 epochs based on communication with the GPT-2 authors (page 4).

12 epochs is the modal, most credible value. Mean of probability mass is probably around 20 epochs, so calculating from that value:

This is probably the total for the whole paper? They released two versions of the base model, one of which is just trained further than the other, and they have two fine-tuned versions. If fine-tuning compute is minor, then this total is close to the largest training compute for any single model in the paper.
