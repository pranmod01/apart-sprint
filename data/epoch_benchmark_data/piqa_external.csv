The number of epochs is not reported, but another paper [1] claims in table 1 that it is 20 or 100 epochs, and another paper [2] claims 12 epochs based on communication with the GPT-2 authors (page 4).

12 epochs is the modal, most credible value. Mean of probability mass is probably around 20 epochs, so calculating from that value:
