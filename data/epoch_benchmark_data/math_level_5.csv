Maverick was trained using co-distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth. It isn't 100% clear that all 22T tokens used distillation, but we assume this for the time being.

Estimating training compute from parameters and tokens:

(Implying mean throughput was 262 TFLOPS/GPU, or 13.2% MFU in FP8)


The model card also states that Llama 4 Maverick used 2.38M H100-hours.
The blog post gives a figure of 390 TFLOPS/GPU, but this may have been the utilization rate for Behemoth, or all of the models together. Using this utilization, we have:
Compute = 390 TFLOP/s * 2.38 million hours = 3.342e24 FLOP

Mistral spent <20 million euro (meaning approximately 20 million?) to train Mistral Large:

Assuming bf16 or fp16, H100 SXM performance is 989 TFLOPS
At 1.9 euro per H100-hour and 30% utilization, spending 20M euro produces 1.12*10^25 FLOP.

6 * 37B (active params) * 14.8T = 3.2856e24 for pretraining.

We know they trained in FP8. H800s get 1.513e15 FLOP/s in FP8:
2.688M * 3600 * 1.513e15 * MFU = 3.2856e24

Suggests a MFU of 0.2244 in pre-training. If we assume MFU was the same in post-training, that adds an additional:

0.1M * 3600 * 1.513e15 * 0.2244 = 1.222e23 FLOP from post-training
